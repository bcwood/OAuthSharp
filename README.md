OAuthSharp
==========

OAuthSharp is a .NET OAuth client that's actually easy to use. There are other .NET OAuth clients out there, but I found them all difficult to use, and they had too many dependencies.

OAuthSharp is lightweight, has no external dependencies, and is super simple to start using. 

There is currently only support for OAuth v1, but v2 support is definitely in the works.
